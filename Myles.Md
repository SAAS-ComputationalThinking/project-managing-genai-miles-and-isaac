* Did you enjoy working with a generative AI tool as a code assistant?
* What was *more* difficult about using the AI tool, rather than doing it yourself? What was less difficult?
    I did enjoy working with generative AI as a code assistant. Something that was more difficult for me was to figure out where the errors were occuring as they happened. This was difficult because I did not write the code and so it was hard to understand some of the parts of the code, which in turn made it hard to find errors if I dont know some of the code names and the way the code was created. Something that was easier was just the fact that it can write you a bunch of code for whatever you want and there is usually minimal errors.

* Did the AI tool ever give you code that was wrong?  What did it do?
    I never game us code that was wrong but it instead sometimes missed a colon or the spacing got messed up when it got pasted into VS code. All that we did was go through the code and use our general knowledge to figure out what was wrong with the code because overall all the code it gave us was correct but the little details got messed up sometimes.

* What advice do you have about how to interact with an AI tool to get better results? 
    I would say that to get better results try to be specific and dont be afraid to prompt chatGPT multiple times. A lot of the time when your not specific enough it will guess on some pieces of the code and will not be what your looking for.
