* Did you enjoy working with a generative AI tool as a code assistant?
Yes, it was super easy to prompt and worked first try although I do think more indepth games might be harder to structure and prompt.

* What was *more* difficult about using the AI tool, rather than doing it yourself? What was less difficult?
Way more difficult to code it my self, everything was less difficult because it would give notes on what does what and everything was generated for me.

* Did the AI tool ever give you code that was wrong?  What did it do?
No all of the code it gave us worked, but we tweaked it to make the game more fun/challenging to play.

* What advice do you have about how to interact with an AI tool to get better results?
Give it as specific of istructions as possible for the best results.
